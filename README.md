# Analyzing California Air Quality Data - Team-Based Learning Activity : [GROUP U24]

This in-class team-based learning activity [ITBL1] focuses on analyzing air quality trends in California using real-world data from 2020. The dataset includes key air quality indicators such as **PM2.5 concentration levels, AQI values, and regional location information**. The objective is to help students develop **data analysis skills** by performing operations such as **sorting, filtering, and computing new insights**.  

**Key Learning Outcomes:**  
1. **Understanding the Dataset**  
2. **Sorting and Filtering Data** .  
3. **Statistical Analysis**
4. **Data Manipulation** 
5. **Problem-Solving**
   
This activity provides a **hands-on experience in environmental data analysis**, encouraging teamwork and critical thinking. It also highlights the **impact of air pollution on public health** and reinforces **data science techniques** relevant to real-world applications.


## How to Open the Notebook in Google Colab

1. Click the link below to open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab:  

   [![Open in Colab]([https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-username/your-repo/blob/main/Group_Name_AirQuality_Analysis.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kVOben7F9RECF2T8x43xW5Uc4pyJWlBU?usp=sharing))

2. Once Colab opens, you can run the notebook cells to explore the analysis.
3. Ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries imported, such as datascience and numpy , using :

```python
from datascience import *
import numpy as np
from google.colab import files
   ```

4. Make sure you upload the dataset correctly, it can be found here [![https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thaddeussegura/california-air-quality-2020-through-sept10th]]
